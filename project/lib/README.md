# Submodule projects
Lime includes code from several other C/C++ libraries, listed below. Lime prefers to use GitHub repositories as its submodules, purely so that the links will be clickable when viewed on github.com. However, some of these repos are mirrors, with the development being conducted elsewhere.

**_Always submit issues and pull requests to the primary repo, not to a GitHub mirror._**

[^1]: Attempting to make a shallow clone of a SourceForge repo (as GitHub Actions does) usually produces the error "Server does not allow request for unadvertised object." Only the most recent commit is "advertised," and all others cause the error. As long as this is the case, Lime will have to use GitHub mirrors of SourceForge repos.
